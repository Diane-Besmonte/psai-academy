For example, some were unaware their loans had gone into delinquency or were surprised by sudden reporting to credit bureaus.\\n\\n2. **Difficulty Accessing or Understanding Payment Options:** Several complainants faced challenges in setting up manageable repayment plans or navigating online systems that failed or provided confusing information. They often reported being locked out of portals or not receiving proper guidance on deferment, forbearance, or repayment options.\\n\\n3. **Interest Accumulation During Forbearance/Deferment:** Borrowers experienced their interest continuing to accrue even when payments were paused, which increased total debt and extended repayment periods. This buildup of interest sometimes rendered it impossible to pay off the loans without increasing monthly payments beyond their means.\\n\\n4. **Financial Hardship and Unmanageable Payments:** Many borrowers faced financial difficulties, stagnant wages, or unemployment, making it impossible to afford the required payments. Despite efforts to negotiate or defer payments, the debt continued to grow due to interest and inadequate support.\\n\\n5. **Errors and Mismanagement by Loan Servicers:** Complaints mention errors such as incorrect balance reporting, unnotified loan transfers, and poor customer service, which contributed to confusion and inability to make timely payments.\\n\\n6. **Lack of Effective Repayment or Forgiveness Options:** Some borrowers felt misled about their repayment obligations and found they were ineligible for forgiveness programs, or the programs did not adequately address their circumstances, leaving them overwhelmed.\\n\\nOverall, the failure to pay back loans was often due to systemic issues like inadequate communication, complex or inaccessible systems, accruing interest during payment delays, and personal financial hardships—all compounded by mismanagement by loan servicers.\\n\\nIf you need more specific details or tailored explanations, feel free to ask!'"

        "4. When we query our Retriever, we will do a similarity search comparing our query vector to the \"child chunks\".\n",
        "5. Instead of returning the \"child chunks\", we'll return their associated \"parent chunks\".\n",

        "- Naive Retriever achieved the highest correctness (100%), showing it consistently returned accurate answers for all queries. It had moderate latency (4.145s) and relatively low token usage, making it both accurate and cost-efficient.\n",
        "\n",
        "- BM25 Retriever was the fastest (2.921s) and cheapest in terms of latency and cost but had lower correctness (66.67%). Its keyword-matching nature makes it fast but less reliable for nuanced queries.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Multi-Query Retriever scored high on correctness (83.33%) by leveraging query reformulations to improve recall. However, it had the highest latency (6.092s) since it executes multiple retrievals per question. Cost and tokens were moderate.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Parent Retriever matched BM25’s correctness (66.67%) and had mid-range latency (3.466s). It excels at retrieving broader context but may bring in less focused information for precise Q&A.\n",
        "\n",
        "### Conclusion:\n",
        "For this dataset, Naive Retriever is the best overall choice, combining perfect correctness with reasonable latency and cost.\n",
        "\n",
        "- BM25 Retriever is ideal if speed is the top priority and some drop in accuracy is acceptable.\n",
        "\n",
        "- Multi-Query Retriever is a strong option for complex queries where reformulating the question can uncover more relevant context, though at the expense of speed.\n",
        "\n",
        "PS: I only ran the evaluation for four retrievers to gather the metrics, as the other two retrievers were commented out due to encountering rate limit issues.\n",
